# PublicAPI
API Demo for Display contents

Build an app that uses any public API from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis. You should implement features like search, and offline storage. When you store data offline it must be encrypted so that it can't be tampered with. Also when a user doesn't have an internet connection, he must be able to see the data stored offline.

Screens:
List Screen - a screen where you will have to implement search.
Detail Screen - screen where you could display the details of a selected item from the list

Instruction:
Use at least 1 UICollectionView
Use at least 1 UITableView
Implement using Swift and MVVM/VIPER
The code should be unit tested
UI has to be responsive
Code must be pushed on a GitHub public repository with incremental commits
Make sure you don't use unnecessary third-party libraries.
